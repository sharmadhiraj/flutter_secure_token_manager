# Flutter Secure Token Manager

### What it does

- **Secure Storage:** Safely stores access token and refresh token.
- **Efficient Token Refresh:** Efficiently renews access tokens upon expiration, ensuring a single
  refresh request even when multiple requests detect token expiry simultaneously.
- **Token Expiry Check:** Provides a mechanism to check if tokens have expired (only for JWT).

### Implementation Steps

1. **Add Package:** Include the package in your Flutter project.

    ```dart
    dependencies:
      flutter_secure_token_manager: ^latest_version
    ```

2. **Set Tokens After Login:**
   Use `FlutterSecureTokenManager().setToken(Token(accessToken, refreshToken))` whenever there are
   changes to tokens.

3. **Implement Token Expiry Check:** If your tokens are not JWT, set the expiry check logic (usually
   done once at the beginning).

    ```dart
    FlutterSecureTokenManager().isTokenExpired = (accessToken) async {
      // Your logic here
      // return true or flase; //
    };
    ```

4. **Token Refresh Logic:** Implement the logic for refreshing the token when it expires.

    ```dart
    FlutterSecureTokenManager().onTokenExpired = (refreshToken) async {
       // Your logic here to get new access token with refreshToken;
       // return newToken;
    };
    ```

5. **Access Token Retrieval:** Use `FlutterSecureTokenManager().getAccessToken()` wherever you need
   the access token. The package will handle the refresh automatically.

    ```dart
    headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${await FlutterSecureTokenManager().getAccessToken()}"
    }
    ```

Note: Ensure these steps are appropriately integrated into your app flow, especially during the
login process and before making authenticated requests.
